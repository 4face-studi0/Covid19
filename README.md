## Contributions
Every contribution is appreciated.

#### Requirements
Follow the Detekt rules from `config/detekt.yml` and apply `config/codeStyle.xml` to your IDE, in _Preferences - Editor - Code Style_.

Follow the **Clean Code** standards, the **S.O.L.I.D.**, **MVVM** for Android Classic and the current pattern for Gradle config.

Write a concise, capitalised, title as your commit, a short description if needed and the ticket number in a new line ( `#7` ), if any.

Name your branch as `type/ticketNumber_title-of-the-branch`, like `fix/7_update-download-folder` or `fix/update-download-folder` if there is no related ticket. Branch types are: `fix, feat, doc, style, refactor, test`.
